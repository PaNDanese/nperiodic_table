# nperiodic_table
 
Slightly improved rendering of periodic table. 

The primary improvement is that the text in the boxes is properly centered.

There are two branches: a detailed periodic table with electronegativities & subshell information, and a simplified version.

There are also some chemistry-related ornaments decorating the document.
